# <img src="gems.png" alt="Logo" width="5%"/> GEMS NT
GEMS NT- GEMS is Essentially Maybe Spinel *Next Technologies.*

Required to build:

* Visual Studio 2019 w/ C#
* [Cosmos OS Dev Tools](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos/releases)

*NOTE: Make sure you have Visual Studio closed while installing Cosmos!*

After installed, go to Debug build settings, change build to ISO, then goto Cosmos (new), and finally then disable Debuging.

When that's done, just build it and enjoy.

## Benefits of using NT over the old GEMS?
* More modern, simple, and easy code!
* Easy to use and compile!
* Clear fixed!
* You can finally input commands! (Type cmds for commands!)
* Text doesn't wrap around to the top!
* All of this (and maybe even more) thanks to Cosmos!
